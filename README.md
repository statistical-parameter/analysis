## Jacob Bernoulli

Jacob was a 17th century mathematican probably most famous for his book `Ars Conjectandi` on combinatorics and probability.

A random experiment with only two outcomes `success` and `failure` where the probability of success is the same in each experiement
is called a Bernoulli trial or binomial trial.

## Vilfredo Pareto

Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto is known for the Pareto principle which is commonly known as the `80/20 rule`.
Vilfredo's famous observation was that about 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.

A Pareto diagram or chart is a histogram that shows categorical data as bars ordered left to right from largest
frequency to lowest as well as a line showing the culumative total.
