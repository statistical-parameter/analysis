# Analysis

Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto is known for the Pareto principle which is commonly known as the `80/20 rule`.
Vilfredo's famous observation was that about 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.

A Pareto diagram or chart is a histogram that shows categorical data as bars ordered left to right from largest
frequency to lowest as well as a line showing the culumative total.
